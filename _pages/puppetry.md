# Puppetry
<p>The Toybox Puppet Theatre closed in 2012 but most activities occurred during the mid '90s.</p><p> The website can be found <a href="https://toybox.io.day">here</a> thanks to github and a github user for the domain.</p>
<p>Nowadays you can listen to Toybox music on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2R0E7AWpJim7YN8EKCKbCi?si=d49624f1bc6a41b9&nd=1">SPOTIFY</a> and get the picture book of the 3 lil pigs show on <a href="https://a.co/d/dtlcTpO">AMAZON</a>.</p>
