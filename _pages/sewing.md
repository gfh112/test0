# Sewing
<p>My Grandmother taught me to sew from a distance by sending her skirts to me to be hemmed as meticulously as they were worn. I've always loved hand sewing since then, whether it be my own outfits, others, bags, teddies, dolls or puppets.</p>
<p>Recently I've gained a great appreciation for handwoven fabrics, especially raw silk and silk thread. It is like a dream to feel the soft organic thread move through the textured fabric and be able to mould and re-mould the piece into whatever it is you want. Below is a pair of silk pants and a dress I made by hand while living in Cambodia.</p>

<p>While running a puppet theatre I created many outfits for puppets and a couple of large puppets created out of stretch fabric over a wire padded frame.</p>

<p>As a Grandmother I enjoy creating dolls and teddies.</p>

<p>For my brand Lotty Roo I am trying to perfect a kangaroo "flya" doll.</p>

<p>Personally I enjoy sewing and creating my own patterns for clothing.</p>
